About the Application

This application shows the countdown in days, hours, minutes, and seconds until the next January 1st.  
As time changes, the countdown updates automatically.  
The goal of this project was to create a dynamic UI that works with real-time data and updates continuously using JavaScript.
The countdown is visually styled to match the festive theme and provides a simple, intuitive user experience.

Technologies Used

- JavaScript 
- HTML  
- CSS

 Challenges and Learnings
 
One challenge in this project was calculating the time difference between the current moment and the target date (January 1st).  
Handling time units and ensuring the countdown updates accurately every second strengthened my skills in JavaScript time functions and DOM manipulation.
